# Web-lab-Classification

This is part 1 of the second programming assignment in course *Web Information Processing and Applications*. In this lab, we should choose a problem in classification or clustering from the UCI datasets (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html), and I chose a classification problem dealing with the quality of wine.

I use both KNN algorithm and the Logistic Regression algorithm in this lab.
